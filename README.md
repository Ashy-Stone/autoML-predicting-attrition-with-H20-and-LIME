# Predicting attrition with Automated Machine Learning (H20) and Machine Learning Interpretability Framework (LIME)

This repo serves to be the code base for my research and prototypes/iterations to learn more about automated machine learning (with H20) and to learn more about machine learning interpretability/explainability (with LIME).

## What?

What I want to accomplish with this is to look more into automated machine learning (ML). In addition, I would like to better interpret machine learning (ML) models or algorithms and also to better explain individual predictions.

Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. 

LIME, which stands for Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations, has opened the doors to complex, high-performance, but previously unexplainable models in business applications

Interpretability/Explainability is the degree to which a human can understand the cause of a decision. Explanation is similar, but in this case, will be for an individual prediction, while interpretability will be for the model.

## Why?

For automated machine learning, the purpose is to reduce the time it takes to complete the ML workflow and automate various steps of ML such as:
	- data pre-processing
	- feature engineering
	- feature extraction
	- feature selection
	- algorithm selection
	- hyperparameter optimization

Automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning offers the advantages of producing simpler solutions, faster creation of those solutions, and models that often outperform models that were designed by hand. In addition, the analyst (me) does not need to be an expert in any particular algorithm, but just needs a general idea and limitations of them.

For interpretability, the purpose is to ensure that stakeholders are able to understand the 'why' or cause of a ML models decisions and its tendencies.

Computers usually do not explain their predictions, which is a barrier to the adoption of machine learning. Things like LIME will help resolve that.
